			<h2>Home</h2>
			<p><b>Our mission is to connect the community to clinical trial organizers in a way that benefits everyone involved.</b></p>
			<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
			<p>We have hundreds of community connections across the nation to help get the word out on clinical trials near you. 
				We specialize in connecting the organizers of various clinical trials to members of the community that may not know about them.</p>
			<h3>What Can I Do?</h3>
			<p>When you participate in a clinical trial, you can help members of your own community and the public at large by 
				helping medical professionals identify diseases earlier, or to find ways to make life better for people with
				chronic health complications.</p>
			<h3>What's In It For Me?</h3>
			<p>While many clinical trials do not offer a reward, many others offer monetary compensation for taking part in them.
				Whether these trials offer compensation or not, you still become a partner in science and can help future generations to live 
				healthier lives. These important medical breakthroughs would not be possible without the generosity of individuals volunteering
				to take part in these trials.

			<h2>Know your rights — HIPPA</h2>
			<p>Excerpt taken from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html#:~:text=The%20Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and,the%20patient's%20consent%20or%20knowledge.">CDC</a>.</p>
			<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal 
				law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient 
				health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. 
				The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
				to implement the requirements of HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule protects a subset 
				of information covered by the Privacy Rule.
			</p>
			<h3>HIPAA Privacy Rule</h3>
			<p>The Privacy Rule standards address the use and disclosure of individuals’ health 
				information (known as <em>protected health information</em> or <em>PHI</em>) by entities subject to 
				the Privacy Rule. These individuals and organizations are called “covered entities.”
			</p>
			<p>The Privacy Rule also contains standards for individuals’ rights to understand and 
				control how their health information is used. A major goal of the Privacy Rule is 
				to make sure that individuals’ health information is properly protected while allowing 
				the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high-quality healthcare, and
				to protect the public’s health and well-being. The Privacy Rule permits important uses 
				of information while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing.
			</p>
			<h3>Covered Entities</h3>
			<p>The following types of individuals and organizations are subject to the Privacy Rule
				 and considered covered entities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><em>Healthcare providers:</em></b> Every healthcare provider, regardless of size of practice,
					 who electronically transmits health information in connection with certain transactions. 
					 These transactions include:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Claims</li>
					<li>Benefit eligibility inquiries</li>
					<li>Referral authorization requests</li>
					<li>Other transactions for which HHS has established standards under the HIPAA Transactions Rule.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b><em>Health plans:</em></b> Health plans include:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurers</li>
					<li>Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)</li>
					<li>Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare+Choice, and Medicare supplement insurers</li>
					<li>Long-term care insurers (excluding nursing home fixed-indemnity policies)</li>
					<li>Employer-sponsored group health plans</li>
					<li>Government- and church-sponsored health plans</li>
					<li>Multi-employer health plans</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Exception: A group health plan with fewer than 50 participants that is administered solely
				 by the employer that established and maintains the plan is not a covered entity.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><em>Healthcare clearinghouses:</em></b> Entities that process nonstandard information they receive
					 from another entity into a standard (i.e., standard format or data content), or vice
					  versa. In most instances, healthcare clearinghouses will receive individually 
					  identifiable health information only when they are providing these processing services 
					  to a health plan or healthcare provider as a business associate.</li>
				<li><b><em>Business associates:</em></b> <em>A person or organization (other than a member of a covered entity’s
					 workforce) using or disclosing individually identifiable health information to perform or
					  provide functions, activities, or services for a covered entity.</em> These functions, activities,
					   or services include:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Claims processing</li>
					<li>Data analysis</li>
					<li>Utilization review</li>
					<li>Billing</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>Permitted Uses and Disclosures</h3>
			<p>The law permits, but does not require, a covered entity to use and disclose PHI, without an 
				individual’s authorization, for the following purposes or situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Disclosure to the individual (if the information is required for access or accounting of
					 disclosures, the entity MUST disclose to the individual)</li>
				<li>Treatment, payment, and healthcare operations</li>
				<li>Opportunity to agree or object to the disclosure of PHI</li>
				<ul>
					<li>An entity can obtain informal permission by asking the individual outright, or by 
						circumstances that clearly give the individual the opportunity to agree, acquiesce, 
						or object</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Incident to an otherwise permitted use and disclosure</li>
				<li>Limited dataset for research, public health, or healthcare operations</li>
				<li>Public interest and benefit activities—The Privacy Rule permits use and disclosure of PHI, without an individual’s authorization or permission, for <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html">12 national priority purposes</a>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When required by law</li>
					<li>Public health activities</li>
					<li>Victims of abuse or neglect or domestic violence</li>
					<li>Health oversight activities</li>
					<li>Judicial and administrative proceedings</li>
					<li>Law enforcement</li>
					<li>Functions (such as identification) concerning deceased persons</li>
					<li>Cadaveric organ, eye, or tissue donation</li>
					<li>Research, under certain conditions</li>
					<li>To prevent or lessen a serious threat to health or safety</li>
					<li>Essential government functions</li>
					<li>Workers’ compensation</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>HIPAA Security Rule</h3>
			<p>While the HIPAA Privacy Rule safeguards PHI, the Security Rule protects a subset of information 
				covered by the Privacy Rule. This subset is all individually identifiable health information a 
				covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits in electronic form. This information is 
				called <em>electronic protected health information, or e-PHI.</em> The Security Rule does not apply to PHI 
				transmitted orally or in writing.</p>
			<p>To comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, all covered entities must:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI</li>
				<li>Detect and safeguard against anticipated threats to the security of the information</li>
				<li>Protect against anticipated impermissible uses or disclosures that are not allowed by the rule</li>
				<li>Certify compliance by their workforce</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Covered entities should rely on professional ethics and best judgment when considering requests for 
				these permissive uses and disclosures. The HHS Office for Civil Rights enforces HIPAA rules, and all 
				complaints should be reported to that office. HIPAA violations may result in civil monetary or criminal 
				penalties.</p>
